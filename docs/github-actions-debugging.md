# GitHub Actions Debugging Checklist

## Current Status
- ✅ Workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ Workflow file is committed and pushed
- ✅ Latest push to main: commit `1c6f610`
- ✅ Workflow syntax appears correct

## Possible Reasons Actions Aren't Running

### 1. GitHub Actions Disabled
**Check:** Go to https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/actions
- If you see "Actions are disabled", you need to enable them
- **Fix:** Go to Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions

### 2. Workflow Disabled
**Check:** On the Actions page, look for the "Deploy to Production" workflow
- It might show as disabled with a yellow badge
- **Fix:** Click on the workflow and click "Enable workflow"

### 3. Repository Actions Settings
**Check:** Settings → Actions → General → Actions permissions
- Should be set to "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- **Fix:** Change the setting if it's restricted

### 4. Secrets Not Configured
**Check:** Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Must have: `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`
- **Issue:** If secrets are missing, the workflow might fail silently or not run
- **Fix:** Add the missing secrets

### 5. Branch Protection Rules
**Check:** Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules for `main`
- Might be blocking pushes or requiring checks
- **Fix:** Review and adjust protection rules

### 6. GitHub Free Plan Limits
**Check:** If you're on free plan
- Free accounts get limited Actions minutes
- Private repos: 2,000 minutes/month
- Public repos: Unlimited
- **Check:** Settings → Billing → Plans and usage

### 7. Workflow File Location
**Verify:** The file must be in `.github/workflows/` (with the dot prefix)
```bash
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

## How to Verify Actions Are Running

### Method 1: GitHub Web UI
1. Go to: https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/actions
2. You should see workflow runs listed
3. Click on any run to see details

### Method 2: Check Commit Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/commits/main
2. Each commit should show a checkmark (✓), X (✗), or yellow dot (⏺) for workflow status
3. Click the status icon to see workflow runs

### Method 3: Repository Insights
1. Go to: https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/pulse
2. Check "Merged pull requests" and "Commits" for workflow activity

## Manual Trigger Test

Add this to your workflow to enable manual triggering:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:  # Add this line
```

Then you can manually trigger from: Actions tab → Deploy to Production → Run workflow

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Re-enable Actions (if needed)
Visit: https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/settings/actions

### 2. Trigger a test commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test GitHub Actions trigger"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Check workflow syntax
```bash
# Install yamllint if available
yamllint .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

### 4. Check GitHub Status
Visit: https://www.githubstatus.com/
- Sometimes GitHub Actions may be experiencing outages

## What to Do Next

1. **Visit your Actions page:** https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/actions
2. **Check if you see any runs at all** (even failed ones)
3. **Look for error messages** if runs appear
4. **Verify secrets are configured:** https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/settings/secrets/actions
5. **Check Actions settings:** https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/settings/actions

## Common Error Messages

### "Resource not accessible by integration"
- **Cause:** Workflow permissions issue
- **Fix:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Set to "Read and write permissions"

### "Unable to resolve action"
- **Cause:** Action not found or incorrect version
- **Fix:** Verify `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.1.0` exists on GitHub

### No runs showing at all
- **Cause:** Actions disabled, workflow file not in correct location, or branch name mismatch
- **Fix:** Verify all checks above

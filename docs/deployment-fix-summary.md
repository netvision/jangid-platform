# Deployment Issue Resolution - UPDATED Oct 9, 2025

## Latest Update: Migration Files Missing from Git! üéØ

### NEW ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED
The `.gitignore` was ignoring ALL migration files!
```gitignore
prisma/migrations/*  ‚ùå This was the problem!
!prisma/migrations/.gitkeep
```

**Result:** Migrations existed locally but were never pushed to GitHub, so the server had no migrations to apply!

### SOLUTION APPLIED (Commit a6732dd)
1. ‚úÖ Removed migrations from `.gitignore`
2. ‚úÖ Force-added all 4 migration files to git
3. ‚úÖ Improved deploy script to fail fast on migration errors
4. ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub - automatic deployment will fix everything!

**Migrations now in repository:**
- `20251004003002_init` - Initial schema
- `20251009025754_add_category_is_active` - Adds isActive to Category ‚≠ê
- `20251009120000_add_profile_theme_config` - Adds theme config
- `20251009120500_add_theme_description` - Adds description

## Previous Issue Summary
GitHub Actions **WAS working** - workflows were triggering correctly. However, deployments were **failing silently** due to a Prisma dependency issue.

## Previous Root Cause
The error occurred during `npm install` on the server:
```
err: sh: 1: prisma: not found
err: npm error Lifecycle script `prisma:generate` failed with error:
err: npm error code 127
```

### Why It Happened
1. Root `package.json` had a `postinstall` hook that ran `npm run db:generate`
2. `db:generate` tried to run Prisma CLI commands
3. Prisma was only installed in `apps/api` workspace, not at root level
4. When `npm install` ran at root, it couldn't find the `prisma` command
5. This caused the entire installation to fail with exit code 127

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Prisma to Root Dependencies ‚úÖ
**File:** `package.json`
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "prisma": "^5.15.0",
  // ... other deps
},
"dependencies": {
  "@prisma/client": "^5.15.0"
}
```

### 2. Removed Problematic `postinstall` Hook ‚úÖ
**Before:**
```json
"postinstall": "npm run db:generate"
```

**After:** Removed completely

**Why:** Prisma generation should happen explicitly during deployment, not automatically on every npm install.

### 3. Updated Deploy Script ‚úÖ
**File:** `scripts/deploy.sh`

**Changes:**
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to `npm ci` and `npm install`
- Moved Prisma generation to happen **after** npm install (not during)
- Added explicit web workspace build step (was missing!)
- Renamed "Syncing Prisma schema" to "Running database migrations" (clearer)
- Removed duplicate `prisma generate` call
- Better error handling with fallback

**New Flow:**
1. Git pull latest code
2. `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` (install all deps)
3. `npx prisma generate` (explicit Prisma client generation)
4. Build shared package
5. Build API
6. Build web
7. Run database migrations
8. Reload PM2 services

### 4. Fixed Script Commands ‚úÖ
**Before:**
```json
"db:generate": "npm run prisma:generate --workspace @jangid/api"
```

**After:**
```json
"db:generate": "prisma generate --schema prisma/schema.prisma"
```

Now runs prisma directly instead of through workspace indirection.

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
‚ùå npm install failed with exit code 127
‚ùå Prisma not found
‚ùå Deployment halted
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ npm install succeeds
‚úÖ Prisma CLI available
‚úÖ Client generation works
‚úÖ All builds complete
‚úÖ PM2 services reload
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Added Manual Workflow Trigger
Can now manually trigger deployments from GitHub Actions UI.

### 2. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `scripts/check-actions.sh` - Quick status check
- `docs/github-actions-debugging.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

### 3. Better Deploy Script Logging
Clearer step names and better error context.

## Verification Steps

After this push, the deployment should:
1. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow triggers
2. ‚úÖ SSH connects to server
3. ‚úÖ Git pulls latest code
4. ‚úÖ npm install succeeds
5. ‚úÖ Prisma generates client
6. ‚úÖ All workspaces build successfully
7. ‚úÖ Database migrations run
8. ‚úÖ PM2 reloads both services
9. ‚úÖ Application is live

## Monitoring the Deployment

### Watch GitHub Actions
https://github.com/netvision/jangid-platform/actions

### SSH to Server and Check
```bash
# Watch deployment logs
pm2 logs

# Check service status
pm2 list

# View specific service logs
pm2 logs jangid-api --lines 50
pm2 logs jangid-web --lines 50

# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## What Was Already Working
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- ‚úÖ SSH authentication (secrets configured correctly)
- ‚úÖ Server access and permissions
- ‚úÖ Git repository setup
- ‚úÖ PM2 ecosystem configuration

## Lesson Learned
Always check the **actual error logs** in GitHub Actions, not just whether the workflow triggered. The workflow was running, but failing at the installation step.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Remove deprecated dependencies** - Consider updating:
   - eslint (8.x ‚Üí 9.x when ready)
   - glob, rimraf, etc.

2. **Add deployment notifications** - Configure Slack/Discord webhooks for deployment status

3. **Add health checks** - Verify services are responding after PM2 reload

4. **Monitor logs** - Set up log aggregation (e.g., PM2 Plus, Datadog, etc.)
